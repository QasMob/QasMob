Hey there! 👋

I'm **Mobeen Qasim**, a software engineer specializing in **frontend engineering and UX**.

I build interactive and user-friendly interfaces that people enjoy using. If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is **React.js, JavaScript, TailwindCSS**, and I also work with **C, Java, Python**. My favorite tools are **Figma** and **Adobe Suite**.

I've worked on multiple personal projects and repos—some are public, others private—but I’m always experimenting and learning new things.

Fun Facts:
- I'm passionate about **UX design and clean frontend code**
- I love designing in **Figma** and bringing it to life with **React**
- I enjoy learning new programming languages and frameworks
- Hobbies: building projects, exploring design, improving my workflow
