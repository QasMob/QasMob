Hey there! ![waving hand](https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif)

I’m Mobeen Qasim, a frontend engineer and UX enthusiast based in Canada.

I build interactive and user-friendly interfaces that people enjoy using. If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is **React.js, JavaScript, TailwindCSS**, and I also work with **C, Java, Python**. My favorite tools are **Figma** and **Adobe Suite**.
